# Experimental new audioserve web client 
**[DEMO AVAILABLE](https://audioserve-new.zderadicka.eu) (shared secret: mypass)**
  
Main motivation is to try new technologies, so [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) are used as main languages and [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) technologies are used.

Now key focus is on efficient caching of audio files, something similar what is available in [Android client](https://github.com/izderadicka/audioserve-android) - so Service Worker and CacheStorage is used.

My idea is that this application should fully replace mobile (Android), client.

As per now it's definitely 'Work In Progress',  some basic things are working, but many things are still missing and there are many issues, so it's now available rather for testing, then for regular use.  But I'm definitely **interested in feedback** so you can log issues on this project.

For now works better in Chrome/Chromium.

## How to use?

You will need audioserve server running somewhere with this client. There are multiple options:

- use `izderadicka/audioserve:experimental` image from dockerhub. But it may not be latest client, as it'is not build automatically yet
  
- clone this project and build client:

```
npm install && npm run build && npm run build-sw
```

- build your own audioserve image with `--build-arg NEW_CLIENT=1`

## Generated code for src/client

Code for client API is generated by [OpenApi Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) using following command:

```
java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -i ~/workspace/audioserve/docs/audioserve-api-v1.yaml -g typescript-fetch -o ./client --additional-properties=typescriptThreePlus=true
```

However there is a bug in generated code (because endpoint /positions/{group}/{colId}/{path} can return either position or array of positions, which is not handled correctly by generator). So had to provide manual fix for PositionsApi.ts line 111
