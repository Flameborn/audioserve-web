# Experimental new audioserve web client 

With Svelte and Typescript.  Will focus now on experiments with Service Workers and audio caching.

**NOT READY FOR REGULAR USAGE - WIP**

## Generated code for src/client

Code do client is generated by [OpenApi Generator](ps://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) using following command:

```
java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate -i ~/workspace/audioserve/docs/audioserve-api-v1.yaml -g typescript-fetch -o ./client --additional-properties=typescriptThreePlus=true
```

However there is a bug in generated code (because endpoint /positions/{group}/{colId}/{path} can return either position or array of positions, which is not handled correctly by generator). So had to provide manual fix for PositionsApi.ts line 111
